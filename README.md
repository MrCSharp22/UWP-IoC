# UWP IoC

A simple library that provides support for IoC containers to integrate with UWP applications. The goal is to allow the container to perform dependency injection using the property injection approach when the app navigates to new pages with minimal effort from the developer.

This library is in ALPHA phase and not recommended for production.
